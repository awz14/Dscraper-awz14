# Dscraper-awz14
Discord Server Scraper
Wassup!
I know you needed this—though it may seem random, it surely has its use! I hope it works well for you, and let's hope it doesn't get patched! If you have any questions, feel free to add me on Discord: awz14.

🚀 How to Set Up
Install Requirements
In the project directory, run the following command to install all required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Script
Execute find.py to start scraping the Discord servers. The script will save the server invites in invites.txt, and it will ensure:

No duplicates are included.
Only servers with 10k+ members are saved.
The process will automatically stop when 100 unique servers are found.

⚙️ Requirements
requests: For handling HTTP requests.
beautifulsoup4: For parsing and scraping HTML content.
Install them using the command above.
