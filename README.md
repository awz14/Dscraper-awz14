# Dscraper-awz14
Wassup, I know you needed this although very random it surely has it's use?? Hope it worked well for you and this better not get patched. Any questions add my discord 'awz14'.

How to set up:
1. Just install requirements using: pip install -r requirements.txt
  [In the directory CMD]
2. Run find.py and wait until it scrapes all your discord servers.
   [In invites.txt discord servers will also be saved there and the script will make sure duplicates are not printed and only servers with 10k members are included]
